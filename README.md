# HabsGrudgeBot

This is a Reddit bot that hurls insults at the enemies of Les Canadiens de Montr√©al. 
This bot is not particularly useful but I had no other productive ideas and I just wanted to get something going. It has been a fun and silly introduction to PRAW and Python in general.

Insults inspired from a virety of sources such as Reddit itself, Letterkenny, Monkey Island, etc.
