# HabsGrudgeBot

This is a Reddit bot that hurls insults at the enemies of Les Canadiens de Montr√©al. 
This bot is not particularly useful but I had no other productive ideas and I just wanted to get something going. It has been a fun and silly introduction to PRAW and Python in general.
The bot can run indefinitely, searching for existing comments and streaming new ones as they are made. It monitors for specific target names and responds accordingly if one is found.

Insults inspired from a virety of sources such as Reddit itself, Letterkenny, Monkey Island, etc.

In the end, I've learned that the target subreddit does not actually allow bots, so this particular bot is not viable. It is, however, a decent example that future bots may be built off.
