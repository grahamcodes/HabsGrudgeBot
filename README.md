# HabsGrudgeBot

This is a Reddit bot that hurls insults at the enemies of Les Canadiens de Montr√©al. 
This bot is not particularly useful, but it has been a fun and silly introduction to PRAW and Python in general.
The bot can run indefinitely, searching for existing comments and streaming new ones as they are made. It monitors for 
specific target names and responds accordingly if one is found.

Insults are inspired from a variety of sources such as Reddit itself, Letterkenny, Monkey Island, etc.

Update: In the end, I've learned that the target subreddit does not actually allow bots, so this particular bot is not viable. The code works in theory but it is far too awesome to be allowed in practice. It is, however, a decent example that future bots may be built off.
